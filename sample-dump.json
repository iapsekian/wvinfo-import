Once a stronghold, vital in the protection of the young Dutch nation, Den Bosch has a charming and well-preserved medieval centre. Wander through the winding streets to see Saint John's Cathedral and then pick out a street terrace on the market square to relax with a chilling beer. Take a boat to see part of the unique Binnendieze, a subterranean network of canals under the city, or head to the south part of town where the ancient ramparts still mark the border of the city and the beginning of a natural reserve area. In short: what Den Bosch lacks in fame, it makes up for in charm. A place well worth visiting.\n\n==Understand==\n[[File:A2 en Pettelaarpark gezien vanaf de bovenste verdieping van het Provinciehuis Noord-Brabant.jpg|thumb|right|Not all of 's Hertogenbosch is made up of medieval buildings - here's a view towards the south of the city]]\nThe population of Den Bosch is approximately 151,000 and with that it is reaching its limits. This because almost all the ground available for building has been used. This does not mean that the whole area is one big city as there are several (big) parks. Likewise, the southern edge of city is totally green as this is a protected natural reserve.\n\n[[File:Overzicht, vijver op de voorgrond - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20413416 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|''Provinciehuis'' - centre of government of North Brabant]]\nDen Bosch can be seen in 9 regions (''note: these regions are built up of several neighborhoods''):\n\n* '''Center''' includes the whole area inside the city walls. Most sights and places to visit can be found in this area.\n* '''North''' is the area between the city center and the A59, which includes the neighborhoods ''de Rompert'', ''Orthen'', ''Herven'' and the area around the ''Prins Hendrik Park''.\n* '''Maaspoort''' is the area north of the A59. Mostly a residential area with some industry.\n* '''Hintham''' is the area around the FC Den Bosch football stadium.\n* '''South''' is the area between the city center and the A2 highway to the south. Residential, but with also a large amount of office buildings.\n* '''West''' is the area west of the central station. High presence of industry, as wel as the residential neighborhoods ''Kruiskamp'' and ''Helftheuvel''. The ''Brabanthallen'' can be found here.\n* '''Engelen''' is the village of ''Engelen'' which is going through the development of ''Haverleij'', a combined residential complex on a golfcourse.\n* '''Rosmalen''', a town to the east of the A2.\n* '''Empel''', small village to the north of ''Rosmalen''.\n\nMost visitor attractions are found in the center, except for the footballstadium and the ''Sportiom''.\n\n[[File:Brabanthallen hoofdgebouw.jpg|thumb|right|Brabanthallen, a historic event venue in Den Bosch]]\n\n==Get in==\n\n===By plane===\n* '''[[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]''', the largest airport in the Netherlands and of Europe's most important intercontinental hubs, is roughly 1.5h away from Den Bosch by train. One needs to change on the way, as there are no direct trains - the most convenient changes are in [[Utrecht]] or [[Breda]]. Either way, the cost is EUR 16.20 for the complete journey. There are multiple times an hour allowing such connections. Consult e.g. [http://9292.nl 9292.nl] for the most convenient option.\n* '''[[Eindhoven#Eindhoven Airport|Eindhoven Airport]]''', the country's second largest, is in Brabant and is mainly served by low-fare carriers from many European cities, with special emphasis on Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. Getting to Den Bosch from Eindhoven is as simple as taking one of the many trains shuttling every hour between the cities, taking less than 20 minutes to connect them, but one needs to get a bus ride from the airport to Eindhoven station first, adding another 20 minutes to the travel time. With some walking and waiting factored it, the total journey time should not be over 50 minutes and will only cost you EUR 6.30 in total.\n* '''[[Rotterdam#By plane|Rotterdam The Hague Airport]]''' is a smaller, business-focused airport in the city of Rotterdam, which can be used as an alternative to Schiphol from some destinations. The airport also does not have a direct train connection - you need to take the bus to Rotterdam Centraal (20 mins) and then a direct Intercity train to 's Hertogenbosch. Total journey time is under two hours and cost is less than EUR 18.\n\n[[File:SHertogenbosch, NSstation foto3 2011-06-18 13.22.JPG|thumb|right|'s Hertogenbosch station]]\n\n===By train===\n[[File:Perron Station Den Bosch.jpg|thumb|right|Platform with the historic roofing]]\nDen Bosch has a good location within the railway system of the \"[http://www.ns.nl Nederlandse Spoorwegen]\" (Dutch Railroads) and almost every city has a direct connection or with a single stopover. Trains depart from Den Bosch main station in city center, which is located at the 'Stationsweg', towards Utrecht-Amsterdam-Haarlem and Utrecht-Schiphol in the north, in the direction of Nijmegen-Arnhem-Zwolle in the east, towards Eindhoven-Maastricht in the south and Tilburg-Breda-Roosendaal in the west.\n\n===By car===\nDen Bosch is accessible via the A2 highway, which has recently (as of 2016) been improved, alleviating the previously chronic traffic jams.\n\nThe major highway that passes Den Bosch is the A2, generally seen from Amsterdam to Maastricht. This one of the busiest highways of The Netherlands, and the part along Den Bosch, known as \"knooppunt Hintham\" and \"knooppunt Empel\" (intersection Hintham and Rosmalen), is in the top 5 of busiest traffic points in The Netherlands.\n\nThe other, less busy, highway passing Den Bosch is the A59, coming from Roosendaal (and the A16) towards Nijmegen. This highway is less busy than the A2, although traffic jams might occur when there is a jam on the A2 as the A59 merges into the A2 for a short part.\n\nNevertheless, if staying outside the peak hours, which are roughly from 7AM-9AM and from 4:30PM–7:30PM, Den Bosch is easily accessible by car.\n\n===By bus===\nThe regional buses, operated by the BBA, link Den Bosch with Tilburg and Eindhoven. As these are the regional buses, they do not go directly between these city but stop at several small villages. Therefore, the fastest and advisable way is using the train.\n\n==Get around==\n{{Mapframe|51.697831|5.300058|zoom=|height=|width=|layer=|staticmap=|align=|name=}}\n[[File:Juli 2012 Den Bosch 049.JPG|thumb|right|Almost every street in the historic centre is worth simply strolling along for great views]]\n===On foot===\nEverything within the city center is reachable by foot. Everywhere in the city, so also in the suburbs, are sidewalks. In the city center, most areas are accessible by foot and bicycle only, and traffic within the city is restricted.\n\n===By bus===\nThere is a free electric citybus that can take you from the central railroad station to the city centre and back.\nIf you want to go to the suburbs (where there is no reason to, as all points of interest are within the city center), Arriva operates a network of buses throughout the city and places in the vicinity. All buses arrive and depart from the central station, although for some lines it is not a terminus. Travelling on these buses is around €1,20 per zone, and you have to purchase at least 2 zones. You can either pay cash at the driver, or buy a 'strippenkaart', a sort of multiple journey card, for this. The last one should only be considered of you intend a lot of traveling, or travel with multiple persons.\n\n[[File:Juli 2012 Den Bosch 086.JPG|thumb|right|When arriving by car, you will need to leave it outside of the historic core of the city]]\n===By car===\nThe city council is trying to get the city center car free, so it is bringing up all kind of measures to deter people from taking the car into the city. Cars can still be parked in the city center, but on Saturdays and Thursday evening these garages are packed. Parking is also available just outside the city center and from there buses are available every 15 minutes for only a few euros including bus trip.\n\n===By bike===\nThe best means of transportation is, just as in the rest of The Netherlands, by bicycle. The city is rather flat and bike friendly <!-- I hope it's safe to assume it is-->\n\n===Taxi===\nWhile taxis are relatively expensive in the Netherlands, they are typically reliable and can be good value if you're a small group. Taxis can be found in front of the train station and are available on call. Companies include {{buy\n| name=Taxi TCO | alt= | url=http://www.taxi-tco.nl/taxi_denbosch.php | email=\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\n| phone=+31 412 484 41 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| lastedit=2015-03-01\n| content=\n}} and {{buy\n| name= Taxi de Hart| alt= | url=http://www.taxidehart.nl | email=\n| address= | lat= | long= | directions=\n| phone=+31 73 5112733 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| lastedit=2015-03-01\n| content=\n}}. They will also offer transportation services to other cities or towns in the region. While they will work by meter for trips inside the city, fixed prices are available for longer trips, e.g. to Eindhoven Airport (around €45) or Schiphol (around €90).\n\n[[File:Sint-Jans-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|The large St John's Cathedral is a central point in the city.]]\n\n==See==\n's-Hertogenbosch is a medieval city and among the oldest cities in the Netherlands. As the city center is historically protected there are still a lot of medieval buildings to be found. Wander around and see the traditional building style.\n\nWhen the Netherlands were still young it was a '''fortified city''' that served for the protection of The Netherlands. Especially on the south side of the city, a lot of these fortifications have been saved and over time restored. Start at ''Bastion Vught'' and walk northwards via the ''Parklaan'', ''Spinhuiswal'', ''Zuidwal'' and ''Bastion Oranje'' and ''Hekellaan'' until you reach the bridge over the ''Zuid Willemsvaart''. This way you cover the best part of the old fortifications. In 2004, the city was awarded ''European Fortress of the year''.\n\n* {{see\n| name=Saint John's Cathedral | alt=Sint Jans Kathedraal | url= | email=\n| address= | lat=51.68808 | long=5.30814 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| lastedit=2016-01-25\n| content=one of the most prominent landmarks of Den Bosch.

Of course some minor maintainance takes place constantly.\n}}\n\n[[File:Demoriaandenboschnl.jpg|thumb|right|De Moriaan]]\n* {{see\n| name=The Moriaan | alt= | url= | email=\n| address= | lat=51.68967 | long=5.30261 | directions=on the market square\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| lastedit=2016-01-25\n| content=the oldest brick building in The Netherlands, built in the 13th century.

It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times but due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. In later times it functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.\n\n==Do==\n[[File:Binnendieze 's-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|The Binnendieze, as seen from one of the tour boats]]\n\n* Take a boat on the Binnendieze, a river that goes below the houses of the center of town, which was used historically as an open sewer, but is now quite a special tour.\n\n==Buy==\nDen Bosch is a popular place for shopping, combining a charming historic atmosphere with a wide variety of stores. In the city centre you'll find all the major chains and department stores. For more characteristic speciality stores or small boutiques try the '''Snellestraat''' or the so-called '''Bossche Kwartier''', meaning the small streets around the Fonteinstraat. The '''Verwerstraat''', with its large monumental buildings, is the place to go for antiques, fashion and design. The '''Vughterstraat''' is another excellent pick, with clothing shops as well as some fine home decoration and furniture places.\n\n'''Markets''' are frequently held on the large market square. The main market is on Saturdays (9-17h) and has a wide selection of food and non-food products. On Wednesday the selection is similar, but the market somewhat smaller. On Fridays, there's a biological market (9-14h) with a good selection of high-quality, mostly regional products. There's another regular market on every first Sunday of the month, but it's a lot smaller than the one on Saturday.\n\n[[File:Bossche bol in the Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|Bossche bolen]]\n==Eat==\nThe city is famous for a local pastry called \"Bossche Bol\" or \"moorkop\", a must-try for any visitor. It's a chocolate ball filled with cream, the size of a tennis ball, typically eaten with a cup of coffee in the afternoon but also for dessert. It makes for a fine sweet treat when you kick back and relax at one of the many cafés, after a day of walking through town.\n*{{eat\n| name=Jan de Groot | alt= | url= http://www.bosschebollen.nl/winkel-lunchroom.php| email=\n| address=Stationsweg 24 | lat= | long= | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price= € 2.05 for one pastry.\n| content=This bakery is particularly well-known for its Bossche bollen and caters to many of the cafés in town.

The '''Korte Putstraat''' and the '''Lange Putstraat''' are your best bet if you're looking for a meal, as they have a particularly broad selection of places with nice outdoor terraces in summer. Typically you'll have no problems finding a table somewhere, but if you have a particular establishment in mind or if you want a good table on the terrace it's definitely wise to reserve ahead, as the best places are often full.\n\n===Budget===\n*{{eat\n| name=Eetcafé 't Keershuys  | alt= | url= http://www.keershuys.nl/| email=info@keershuys.nl\n| address=Lepelstraat 45 | lat= | long= | directions=\n| phone=+31 73 612 80 87 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| content=Cosy place in a 14th-century building, once a small cheese factory.

Even the neighborhoods considered dangerous by the locals are still quite safe during daylight (''Hambaken'', ''Graafsewijk'' and ''Kruiskamp''). If a traveler uses his common sense he will be alright, also during night. The only time the crowd can get a bit rough is during Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. These are the general party nights, so people sometimes drink too much. Nevertheless, there is a lot of police around, and you will be safe if you just take care and mind your own business.\n\n==Go next==\nWell connected and at a fairly central location, there are endless options for next destinations when leaving 'sHertogenbosch. Some of the more prominent nearby places are [[Utrecht]], [[Tilburg]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Breda]] and [[Nijmegen]]. Families will find fun all year round at the [[Efteling]], the country's largest theme park. The Loonse en Drunense Duinen National Park is also a short ride away.\n\n{{routebox\n| image1=NL-A2.png\n| imagesize1=22\n| directionl1=N\n| majorl1=[[Amsterdam]]\n| minorl1=[[Culemborg]]\n| directionr1=S\n| majorr1=[[Maastricht]]\n| minorr1=[[Eindhoven]]\n}}\n\n{{IsPartOf|North Brabant}}\n{{usablecity}}\n{{geo|51.69014|5.29897|zoom=15}}\n\n[[Commons:'s-Hertogenbosch]]\n[[Wikipedia:'s-Hertogenbosch]]"

			"$text": "{{pagebanner|88 Temple Pilgrimage Wikivoyage banner.jpg}}\n{{itinerary}}\nThe '''88 Temple Pilgrimage''' (八十八ヶ所巡り ''hachijūhakkasho-meguri'') is Japan's most famous pilgrimage route, a 1,200&nbsp;km loop around the island of [[Shikoku]].\n\n==Understand==\n[[File:Iwamotoji PilgrimGirl.JPG|thumb|print=full|Pilgrim traveling on foot, [[Kubokawa]]]]\n\nMany of the temples are said to have been founded or restored by the revered monk and scholar '''Kūkai''' (空海), better known by his posthumous title '''Kōbō Daishi''' (弘法大師). Among his many achievements, he is said to have created the ''kana'' syllabary, brought the tantric teachings of Esoteric Buddhism from China, developed it into the uniquely Japanese Shingon sect, and founded Shingon's headquarters on [[Mount Koya]] near [[Osaka]].\n\nWhile most modern-day pilgrims (an estimated 100,000 yearly) travel by tour bus, a small minority still set out the old-fashioned way on foot, a journey which takes about six weeks to complete.  Pilgrims, known as ''o-henro-san'' (お遍路さん), can be spotted in the temples and roadsides of Shikoku clad in a white jacket emblazoned with the characters ''Dōgyō Ninin'' (同行二人), meaning \"two traveling together\" &mdash; the other traveler being the spirit of Kobo Daishi.\n\nLocals will be excited to see someone making the journey on foot, and priests will be relieved that you are not showing up with 100 of your close friends. Make sure that your Japanese is good enough to communicate your feelings to both groups!\n\n==Prepare==\nCompleting the course the traditional way on foot is a serious undertaking that demands several weeks. Good physical fitness and stamina are required to endure the stress of constant walking up and down the hills of Shikoku, in the burning sun and the pouring rain.\n\nMany pilgrims choose to dress up in traditional attire:\n\n* ''byakue'' &mdash; the white coat of a pilgrim\n* ''wagesa'' &mdash; scarf worn around the neck, usually purple, to indicate that you are on a religious pilgrimage\n* ''sugegasa'' &mdash; conical straw hat\n* ''kongōtsue'' &mdash; walking stick, and the one indispensable sign that identifies you as a pilgrim\n\nIn addition, most pilgrims carry a book called ''nōkyōchō'' or ''shuincho'', to collect a red ink stamp (shu-in) by each temple you visit.  All of these items can be purchased -in a formal sense- at Mount Koya or at Ryozenji, the first temple.\n\nIt should be noted that many pilgrims who begin the pilgrimage on foot do not finish it. It is a common to hear of people giving up in Kochi, traditionally known as \"devil's land\" because of its hot temperature, intense rain, and infrequent contact with civilization. (This means you must either camp, sleep in a rest stop or precisely time your journey to only hit towns and be willing to pay up for a hotel room.)\n\n==Get in==\nIt is traditional to prepare by visiting [[Mount Koya]], but the route itself starts at Ryōzenji, near [[Tokushima]], and you have to return here in order to complete your pilgrimage. It is not necessary to start at temple #1 as long as you visit them all, but this is by far the most popular starting point for pilgrims from outside Shikoku, because it is also the closest to people coming from Mt. Koya.　\n\nThe temples are usually visited in clockwise order, although this too, is just a convention &mdash; in practice, as all signs are oriented for pilgrims going clockwise, it's easier to get lost if you try to go against the flow.\n\n==Go==\nMost pilgrims walking on foot average around 25&nbsp;km daily and complete the trip in five to seven weeks.\n\nThe canonical list of temples is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

traveling either by foot or car. They typically cost between ¥4000-7000 per night, including dinner.\n\n* Most temples provide lodging for henro, but it can be quite expensive (around ¥8000 per night is average).\n\n* \"Henro houses\" are run by families or local businesses, and offer rooms (and sometimes food) to walking henro for a very small fee &mdash; or sometimes for free.\n\n* There are also small free lodgings called ''zenkonyado'' and ''tsuyado'' that lodge travelers for the night, although these lodgings can be somewhat poor quality and have very limited facilities. (There is a ''zenkonyado'' near Zentsuji which is said to be haunted.) These were once the primary lodgings for walking henro; however, the island's culture has changed in the last 50 years, and the number of these lodgings have been reduced to just a handful.\n\n==Stay safe==\n\nTraveling in Shikoku is very safe, especially when you wear the traditional henro robes. People will be very helpful if they recognize you as a pilgrim, and will try to participate in your journey by giving you small gifts (''osettai''), which you must always accept.\n\nThe weather can be perilous at times; even during the optimal seasons of spring and fall, it may rain for days &mdash; particularly in the south. Proper preparation and staying up to date with weather reports is a must. You are, however, never far from civilization in case of emergency.\n\nBe careful while walking in Kochi Prefecture, as it is the least populated. The major towns are far apart, and the coast is lined with small fishing towns that tend to shut down by eight or nine in the evening, making it difficult to find accommodations.\n\nShikoku is home to many snakes, including deadly pit vipers. When walking through brush or grass, stomping or otherwise making noise will divert most snakes from your path.\n\nJuly and August are very hot, and attempting to walk the pilgrimage at the peak of summer is asking for a bad case of heatstroke. But for the brave, it can mean small crowds and almost guaranteed space at the henro houses. April and October are the best times to go, though accommodations will be particularly crowded.\n\n==Go next==\nIn one tradition you aren't done when you reach the 88th temple &mdash; some believe you still have to trek back to the 1st to officially complete your pilgrimage! Another tradition suggests that closing the circle is not necessary and it is better to leave it open ended. However it is more common nowadays to return to the 1st temple. \n\nAlso if you've made it this far, it's only good manners to return to [[Mount Koya]] to give your thanks to Kobo Daishi.\n\n==Other Pilgrimage Routes in Japan==\n* [[Chugoku 33 Kannon Temple Pilgrimage]] - If you have the energy, you can easily begin this pilgrimage right after the Shikoku pilgrimage\n* [[Narrow Road to the Deep North]] - Trace the steps of the famous poet Matsuo Bassho\n\n[[WikiPedia:Shikoku Pilgrimage]]\n\n{{related|Shikoku}}\n\n{{usableitinerary}}"

Known as ''Aix-la-Chapelle'' in French and ''Aken'' in Dutch, the city has played a prominent role in early Medieval Europe, when it became the favoured residence of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor who created the empire in the late 8th and early 9th century and built the city's impressive cathedral, where he is now buried along with a succession of later German rulers, many of whom were also crowned in the city.\n\nApart from its medieval significance and a wealth of preserved artifacts, Aachen is also known for its springs, which have been attracting visitors since the Ancient Roman times and continue to do so today, with a number of historic baths and hotels sprinkled around the city. Contributing to the city's wealth and prominence is also the technical university, which made Aachen a hub for modern technologies and provides a sizeable student population (over 40 000 of the total 250 000 inhabitants). With all this, Aachen is now a multi-cultural, popular tourist destination.\n\nHistorically this spa-town was a prominent city, the place where the German Kings were crowned, and a famously favoured residence of Charlemagne who still lies buried in the impressive cathedral he himself had built. The city is packed with historic sights that remind of those days, including medieval buildings, city gates and beautiful fountains.\n\n[[File:Aachen-dom-oktogon-s1.jpg|thumb|Aachen Cathedral - Carolingian Octagon]]\n\n==Understand==\nAachen was the preferred residence of Charlemagne,  \"Roman\" Emperor from 800 to 814 AD and king of an empire covering much of modern-day Italy, France, Germany and the Benelux. Additional information can be found at the [http://www.route-charlemagne.eu/Startseite/index.html?lang=EN Route Charlemagne Aachen] website.\n\nAs Aachen is a legally recognised spa, it could technically call itself Bad Aachen, but refuses to do so, as it then wouldn't be listed first in almost all alphabetical lists.\n\nThe city lies at the borders of Germany with Belgium and the Netherlands, forming the economic region called the '''Euregio'''. There are several Euregios in Europe, but regionally speaking just of \"the Euregio\" is understood to mean the one centered on Aachen.\n\n==Get in==\n{{Mapframe|50.778|6.084|zoom=14|lang=en}}\n{{Mapshape}}\n===By plane===\nAachen shares its own airport with Maastricht, but '''[http://www.maa.nl/en-us/ Maastricht-Aachen airport]''' (located some 40&nbsp;km outside the city centre, in the Netherlands) is connected to only a limited number of international destinations and served by budget carriers. There's an Airport Express shuttle which runs regularly to and from the main Aachen bus station. It's called [http://www.gilbacher.com Gilbacher] AirportXpress and leaves from platform 4. Tickets can only be purchased from the driver and costs €10. There are no trains between Aachen and the airport.\n\nThe nearest large airports are [http://www.duesseldorf-international.de/ Düsseldorf] ({{IATA|DUS}}) and [http://www.airport-cgn.de/index.php Cologne-Bonn] ({{IATA|CGN}}).  Both airports can be reached by train, via the Düsseldorf and Cologne central stations respectively. Other small airports within reasonable distance are Weeze ({{IATA|NRN}}, trains) and \"Brussels\" South [[Charleroi]] Airport ({{IATA|CRL}}, trains). Also Liège (Lüttich) airport in Belgium is around 45min car journey away. Antwerp airport, also in Belgium, requires a 90-minute car ride. Finally, Eindhoven airport in the Netherlands is at 1 hour car ride distance. Probably Aachen is quite unique in having a total of 8 airports in 3 countries within 140&nbsp;km.\n\nIf for some reason none of the nearby airports are feasible or affordable, the airport in [[Frankfurt airport|Frankfurt]] ({{IATA|FRA}}), Germany's main hub, has a direct ICE connection and offers a number of trains to Aachen with one interchange or less.\nFor some airports the rail&fly programme the German railways offer together with several airlines might be an option. For more on that see [[rail air alliances]]\n\n===By train===\n[[Image:VorplatzAachenHBf.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aachen central station (Hauptbahnhof)]]\n====From France and Belgium====\nBoth '''[http://www.thalys.com Thalys]''' and '''[http://www.bahn.com ICE-Trains]''' connect {{Marker|type=listing|name=Aachen Hauptbahnhof|lat=50.768005|long=6.091014|url=http://www.bahnhof.de/bahnhof-de/Aachen_Hbf.html?hl=aachen}} with [[Liège]] and [[Brussels]] with Thalys trains continuing to [[Paris]]. There are also local trains from [[Liège]] every two hours.\n\n====From elsewhere in Germany====\nLocal trains (''Regionalexpress'') from [[Cologne]] and [[Düsseldorf]] run every half hour and take around 55 minutes from Cologne, 85 to 110 minutes from Düsseldorf. Ten times per day, high speed trains go from [[Cologne]] to [[Brussels]] via Aachen (around 35 minutes), either Inter City Express (coming from [[Frankfurt]]) or Thalys (continuing to Paris).\n\n===By bus===\n\n[http://www.eurolines.de/de/startseite/ eurolines] travel to and from Aachen. There are direct journeys to London (approximately 10 hours), Brussels (3 hours), Paris (6.5 hours) and Prague (11.5 hours), among others. Coaches depart from Wilmersdorfer Straße, on the outskirts of the city. The selection of [[Long distance bus travel in Germany|domestic routes]] is surprisingly less extensive, although Aachen is not far from Cologne, which is served by many more routes.\n\n[[File:Aachen, Münsterplatz, 2011-07 CN-01.jpg|thumb|right|The Münsterplatz]]\n===By car===\nBeing on major routes from the Netherlands and Belgium to Germany, easily reachable via the A4 and A44.\n\n[http://www.apag.de/ Parking] in the town centre costs around €2 per hour.

Car-sharing is very common in Germany, but you should of course be cautious when booking a trip nonetheless. [http://www.blablacar.de/ blablacar.de] and [http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/ mitfahrgelegenheit.de] are good resources for finding rides to Aachen, although you're less likely to be successful if you're looking to book far in advance. Payment is expected.\n\n===From The Netherlands ===\n*'''Bus line 50''' from [[Maastricht]] serves Aachen every 15 minutes and passes through [[Margraten]] and [[Vaals]]. '''Bus line 44''' runs between [[Heerlen]] and Aachen (45 min, €3.95)   For €8 you can buy a ticket, which allows all-day travel on South Limburg bus routes, including those to local cities such as Heerlen, and selected train routes.  It is 1 h 15 min from Maastricht.  See [http://www.veolia-transport.nl/dienstregeling/ Veolia Transport] for timetables (Regio: Limburg).\n*From Heerlen there's also a direct '''train''' connection.\n*By car, you can just drive in via Vaals or take the highway.

The euregio-Bahn is a local line that stops at the stations Aachen West (not far from RWTH Aachen University), Aachen-Schanz, Aachen Hauptbahnhof (the most convenient for the city centre) and Aachen-Rothe Erde. A single ticket for a journey within the city is €2.55; ticket machines are available at all stations.\n\nThe old town is best explored on foot and orientation signs can be found all around. Aachen at a whole is a fairly large city. A car can come in handy but parking can get expensive, especially in the center of town.\nFortunately, Aachen has an excellent city '''bus''' system, operated by [http://www.aseag.de ASEAG], including a few night bus lines. You can get tickets from the bus driver. You can rent a '''bike''' at the \"fahrrad station\", in the central train station. Although it is not the most biker-friendly town in Germany, there are a number of bike routes and getting around on bike is increasingly popular. '''Taxis''' are readily available on the train stations but also on streets.\n\n==See==\n[[File:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpg|thumb|right|Aachen Cathedral]]\n* {{see\n| name=Aachen Cathedral | alt= | url=http://www.aachendom.de/ | email=\n| address=Domhof 1 | lat=50.77475 | long=6.083922 | directions=\n| phone=+49 241 477090 | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours=Opening times of the Cathedral: Jan-Mar: Daily 7AM-6PM, Apr-Dec: Daily 7AM-7PM.

Around 800, the core building of the Palace Chapel was built. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the Gothic choir (the \"Aachen glasshouse\"), the north and south chapel were added. Through the centuries, many other constructions and decorations were completed. Today, it is a unique and beautiful two-storey cathedral of classical pillars, bronze railings, golden masterpieces, glassworks, etc.<br>The cathedral is the memorial and funeral place of Charlemagne (+814). During 936-1531, 30 kings and 12 queens were anointed, crowned and enthroned here. In the Middle Ages, it was one of Christendom's most important venues for pilgrimage, together with Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago de Compostela. [http://www.heiligtumsfahrt2007.de/ Heiligtumsfahrt] (the Aachen pilgrimage) takes place every year since 1349 (the next one will be in June 2014).

Its population, as of 2016, is 134,672, making it the fourth largest city in [[Denmark]].\n[[File:Aalborg Havnefront 2.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Aalborg waterfront by night]]\n\n== Understand ==\nAalborg is the capital and largest city in the region of North Jutland. A university town and a regional centre for education. It has a long history as an industrial  and port town with an international airport that also serves [[Copenhagen]].\nAalborg is an old town with many preserved buildings and important prehistoric relics, but also thriving cultural life with several institutions of national importance. The Tourist Information of Aalborg has its headquarters in Nordkraft, a culture centre at the harbourfront.\n\n==Get in==\n===By plane===\n\n[http://norwegian.com/ Norwegian] and [http://flysas.com SAS] have flights from Copenhagen to Aalborg, while Norwegian also offers international direct flights from European cities. The airport is the third largest in Denmark and is located north of the city. Take Bus no 2 or a taxi (very expensive!) to town. The bus is infrequent on weekends and evenings, and stops the service rather early (around 23:00). If you arrive very late, have little luggage and small budget, you can walk ~2km until the Lindholm train station. Bus or train to the center should be still available after midnight.\n\n===By bus===\nAalborg Busterminal on John F Kennedy Plads (The John F Kennedy square, phone: 98 12 87 13) right by the station is a large regional hub for long distance, regional and local buses. Express buses (''XBus'' [http://www.xbus.dk/]) leaves several times per day towards Aarhus (via Hadsund), Løgstør, Holstebro, Viborg (via Silkeborg) and Esbjerg. In addition regional buses (locally known as rutebil) connects to nearly every city of some size in North Eastern Jutland.\n\n* '''Abilskou''' route 888 [http://www.abildskou.dk/go.asp?LangRef=4] to [[Copenhagen]] takes 5 hours, DKK 250 (DKK 430 return).\n\n===By train===\n\nAalborg is on the [[Copenhagen]], [[Roskilde]], [[Odense]], [[Aarhus]] Line. 4½ hours/DKK 402 to Copenhagen.\n\n===By ferry===\n\nThere are ferries from Norway/Sweden/UK coming to North Jutland ([[Hirtshals]] or [[Frederikshavn]]). From there you can take bus or train to Aalborg.\n\n===By car===\nFrom Frederikshavn: Use the E45 southbound to Aalborg.<br />\nFrom Hirtshals: Use the E39 southbound to Aalborg.<br />\nFrom Aarhus: Use the E45 northbound to Aalborg.<br />\n\n==Get around==\n{{Mapframe|57.044163|9.916059|zoom=12|height=|width=|layer=|staticmap=|align=|name=}}\nIn the center it easy to walk by foot. To go further, there is a good public bus system (20 DKK for 1.5h if you pay cash, 12 DKK after 18:00). The buses don't go at night, and taxis are very expensive. The best way is still to get around by bicycle, you can rent one close to tourist information office or at several other locations using the city-bike system. There is also a city bike scheme where you may borrow a bicycle after giving a 20 DKK deposit. For longer stays, a better option is buying one. Police has auctions once per month, you can ask about them in the police station.\n\nNørresundby is north of Limfjordsbroen.\n\n==See==\n* {{see\n| name=Aalborg Zoo | alt= | url=http://aalborgzoo.dk/UserFiles/engelsk_hjemmeside.pdf | email=\n| address=Mølleparkvej 63 | lat=57.037047 | long=9.897919 | directions=\n| phone= | tollfree= | fax=\n| hours= | price=\n| wikipedia=Aalborg Zoo\n| content=Cosy zoo with many \"classic\" zoo animals such as giraffes, elephants and big cats.
